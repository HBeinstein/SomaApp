**Name of Project: Meditation/Breathing App (official name tbd!)**

Project's Purpose or Goal: My project will be a meditation/mindfulness app that uses the Fitbit API (https://dev.fitbit.com/) to collect biometric data from a user and tracks their heart rate/breath rate. The project will be a web app that allows a user to login to their Fitbit account, and then brings them to a “start meditation” interface. Once a user starts their meditation, they will be able to see a visual (that I’m planning to render using React Three Fiber) that will last a couple of minutes (the duration of the meditation). By connecting the graphics to the biometric information retrieved by the Fitbit API every few seconds, I’ll be able to alter the scene depending on how fast/slow the user’s heart/breath rate is. The goal is to create a visual that reacts in real-time to how relaxed the user is, and provide the user with something to focus on during their meditation.

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

Web interface that includes login screen
React three fiber generated graphics 
App needs to be able to retrieve heart rate/breath rate in real-time or at very least every couple of seconds

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

Fitbit API (https://dev.fitbit.com/)
React Three Fiber
React and Javascript

**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

Responsive web interface (viewable on mobile and tablets as well as desktop)
Allowing the user to select from multiple scenes (instead of one default scene)
Potentially creating a mobile version of app using React Native after web app is complete

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

React Native
